        UCISA stands for University of Canterbury Indian Students Association. It was established in 2022 by Dristhi and others. The club provides a platform for Indian students, both new and old, to come together and build a community, especially for those who have moved to New Zealand, leaving behind their family and friends. UCISA offers opportunities for students to meet new people, participate in events, festivals, sports events, and more.
